# The idea behind this project
There are lots of PHP frameworks. Although they implement their features in
unique ways, they share lots of common points, such as design patterns,
architectural decisions and structural organization.

This project is for me a way to be a better programmer. Understanding how
frameworks are organized, how they solve problems and how is the mindset
of a framework author may ease my life when having to deal with a project
using a unknown framework.

The master plan is to end up with a package in packagist, let's see if this
is going to work.
